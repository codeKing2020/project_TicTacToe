## log

* version 0.1  
I have set up the basic HTML. I spent most of my time planning the functionality of the JavaScript which is why there is not much to see. The JS planning was not too hard, I've planned everything, so hopefullly I won't face too much difficulty changing the plans to reality. More updates in the next release.

* version 0.11  
I forgot to log my readme file, so entering it here :)

* version 0.2
Built newPlayer factory function and gameBoard module, well, part of it. I have built a way to update the gameBoard array, and a way to check if there is a tie or win, now I have to find a way to communicate that across to the user or at least take an appropriate action. This one was a bit tough and demanding, but, it's been a great ride! Now to bind everything together, the entire gameBOard module must be finished tomorrow, and then move onto the UI side of things. Will be testing more as soon as I;m done with the gameBoard module.
