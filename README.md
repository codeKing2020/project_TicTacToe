## log:

* version 0.1  
I have set up the basic HTML. I spent most of my time planning the functionality of the JavaScript which is why there is not much to see. The JS planning was not too hard, I've planned everything, so hopefullly I won't face too much difficulty changing the plans to reality. More updates in the next release.

* version 0.11  
I forgot to log my readme file, so entering it here :)
